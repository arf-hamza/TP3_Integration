    "description": "React is a JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces. TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that adds static typing to the code. By combining React with TypeScript, we benefit from advantages such as faster error detection and improved collaboration on large projects. Next.js is a framework that simplifies the development of React applications by offering features such as server-side rendering, static pre-rendering, and simplified routing. Together, React, TypeScript, and Next.js provide a solid foundation for building modern and scalable web applications. We are carrying out our work using this new technological stack."
